Introduction
Heart disease is a major health concern, and machine learning can be a powerful tool for predicting its presence. This project demonstrates how to build and evaluate a heart disease prediction model. The notebook is divided into five main sections, each focusing on a different part of the machine learning pipeline.

Project Structure
Disease_Detector.ipynb: The main Jupyter Notebook containing all the code and explanations.

heart_disease_uci.csv: The dataset used to train the model, downloaded from Kaggle.

heart_rf_model.pkl: The saved Random Forest model, which is used for predictions.

heart_scaler.pkl: The saved StandardScaler object, which is used to scale new data for predictions.

heart_user_template.csv: A sample CSV file that can be used as a template for user input.

heart_dataset.csv: An example user dataset used in the prediction demo.

How to Run the Notebook
Open in Colab: The easiest way to run this notebook is to open it in Google Colab. Click the "Open In Colab" badge at the top of the notebook.

Run All Cells: Simply go to Runtime > Run all to execute all the cells in the notebook sequentially.

Local Environment: If you prefer a local setup, ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. You'll also need the libraries listed in the notebook, which you can install via pip:

Bash

pip install pandas scikit-learn seaborn matplotlib jupyter
Then, open the notebook with Jupyter:

Bash

jupyter notebook
Key Steps
Day 1: Data Preprocessing & EDA
This section focuses on preparing the dataset for modeling.

Loading Data: The notebook downloads a heart disease dataset from Kaggle.

Handling Missing Values: Missing numeric values are filled with the mean of their respective columns.

Exploratory Data Analysis: Histograms and a correlation heatmap are generated to understand the data distribution and relationships between features.

Day 2: Model Training
One-Hot Encoding: Categorical columns are converted into a numerical format using one-hot encoding, making them suitable for the models.

Feature and Target Split: The dataset is split into features (X) and the target variable (y), which indicates the presence (1) or absence (0) of heart disease.

Day 3: Train/Test Split, Normalization, and Modeling
Splitting the Data: The data is divided into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

Data Scaling: Numeric features are standardized using StandardScaler to ensure they have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

Logistic Regression: A baseline Logistic Regression model is trained on the scaled data.

Day 4: Model Evaluation, Random Forest, and Feature Importance
Model Evaluation: The Logistic Regression model's performance is assessed using accuracy, a classification report, and a confusion matrix.

Random Forest: A more advanced RandomForestClassifier is trained for comparison. This model typically offers better performance.

Feature Importance: The Random Forest model is used to determine which features are most important for predicting heart disease. This provides valuable insights into the data.

Day 5: Save Models, User Upload & Prediction (Demo App)
Saving Models: The trained Random Forest model and the StandardScaler are saved using joblib.

Prediction Demo: A simple interactive demo is provided. Users can upload their own patient data in a CSV file (using the provided template) to get a heart disease prediction from the saved model. The notebook handles all the necessary preprocessing steps to ensure the user data is in the correct format for the model.

Models
Logistic Regression: A simple yet effective linear model used as a baseline. It provides a good starting point for classification tasks.

Random Forest: An ensemble model that builds multiple decision trees and merges their predictions. It's known for its high accuracy and ability to handle complex datasets.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle: Heart Disease Data. It includes various clinical features that are used to predict the presence of heart disease.
